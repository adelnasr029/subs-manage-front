### üõ†Ô∏è Optimization

This project underwent refactoring to improve performance, remove redundant code, and enhance styles and design. Below are the key changes:

#### **1. Component Refactoring**
- **Improved Performance:** Used `React.memo` and optimized `useEffect` dependencies to reduce unnecessary re-renders.
- **Logic Simplification:** Extracted shared logic into custom hooks and reusable utilities.
- **Removed Redundancy:** Eliminated unused states, props, and repetitive code.

#### **2. Style Enhancements**
- **Design Improvements:** Upgraded styles using **CSS Modules** or **Tailwind CSS** for better visuals and scalability.
- **Responsive UI:** Ensured layouts are fully responsive with optimized media queries.
- **Aesthetics:** Added smooth animations with **Framer Motion** and enhanced accessibility.

#### **3. Performance Boost**
- **Code Splitting:** Integrated `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for on-demand loading.
- **State Optimization:** Used `useReducer` for complex state management.
- **Asset Optimization:** Minified images, used `WebP`, and implemented lazy loading.

#### **4. Code Cleanup**
- **Readability:** Refactored large components into smaller, reusable ones.
- **Formatting:** Enforced consistent styles with **ESLint** and **Prettier**.

#### **5. Improved User Interaction**
- Enhanced forms with validation (e.g., `Formik`, `Yup`) and added clear feedback mechanisms (spinners, tooltips, and success/error messages).

These updates resulted in better performance, maintainability, and an improved user experience.
